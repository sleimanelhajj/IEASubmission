# Description: Contains predefined shape coordinate lists (square, circle, triangle, etc.)
# and a helper function to shift (translate) those shapes so that they fit neatly within the grid.

# Shape coordinate definitions
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Each shape is defined as a list of (row, column) tuples. 
# They generally assume a certain bounding box (e.g., 5x5, 9x9, etc.) 
# but still need to be shifted or scaled to fit a particular grid.

# Purpose: Takes a list of shape coordinates and shifts (translates)
